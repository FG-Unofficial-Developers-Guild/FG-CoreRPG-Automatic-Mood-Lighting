# PFRPG Spell Formatting
 This extension modifies the character-specific copies of spells (accessed via their actions tab) to allow fully-formatted descriptions including italics, tables (detect magic is a great example), links, etc. At this time, you need to drag the spells into actions after installing this extension for the special formatting to be included.
